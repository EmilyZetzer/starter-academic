I'm a Clinical Research Associate (CRA) at IMARC Research and a MS student in the Biostatistics Program at Case Western Researve University.

The most important question of my career has been “why?”. Whether questioning current processes, seeking to better understand methods, or exploring wholly new concepts, it all begins with my desire to know more. As a result, my academic and professional career has grown into an interconnected network of theoretical and practical research, fused together by clinical experience. Due to my specific academic and professional experiences, I have a well-rounded understanding of the clinical trials life-cycle and statistical analysis.
